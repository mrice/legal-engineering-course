# 101 Intro to Legal Engineering

## Overview

This is a introductory course intended primarily for lawyers interested in learning the technologies and skills needed to be successful in this nascent discipline.  The focus is on the process of developing software in a team, not on learning how to programming.

*NOTE:* this course is very much in progress - please consider providing a suggestion or contribution (see below).

## Prerequisites

**None**. Just bring your deep legal analysis along with an interest in learning about this exciting new field.

## Format

This course is intended to be delivered in a number of sessions (below) of the same length.  The sessions could be delivered sequentially, or broken up over a number of days or even weeks.

## Sessions

1. **How Software Gets Made and Why the Legal Engineering Role Matters** - An overview of how software gets developed in the real world, including product design, project management, designing software architecture, managing code, meetings and interactions.
2. **Software Engineering** - The technical skills - a brief overview of how to write software, including a simple "Hello, World," different languages commonly used, what it means to "engineer" software as opposed to simply programming, and what a legal engineering needs to do to learn how to learn and keep up with any given programming language.
3. **Team Skills** - The "soft"* skills - of how to work in a team of software engineers, product managers, and project managers including topics like safety, transparency and resiliency, and failing fast and often.
4. **Legal Engineering** - A detailed session on how to apply your legal analysis skills in a team environment using your new programming and team skills.

\* the so-called "soft" skills are actually quite hard, possibly the hardest skill to master in the software engineering industry
